%\section{Summary}
%Biomechanical engineer with 10+ years research experience involving rehabilitation engineering, biomechanics, and human-centered product design. I develop new medical technologies to address movement disorders that develop after injury, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury. I'm particularly interested in solving engineering problems for the hospital \& health care industry with innovative and emerging technology, such as virtual reality, ultrasound, and noninvasive neural stimulation. 

%\section{Personal Statement}
%I am a biomechanical engineer conducting research at the intersection of physical rehabilitation and human-centered product design. I work with clinicians to solve healthcare problems using innovative and emerging technology, such as virtual reality, wearable ultrasound, and noninvasive neural stimulation. In my current position, my goals are to 1) translate engineering solutions out of the lab and provide them to actual patients in need, 2) build institutional capacity for novel training, research, and outreach related to rehabilitation engineering and human-centered design practices, and 3) incorporate human-centered and community-engaged design into engineering processes. I teach senior undergraduate/graduate-level courses on design and academic research. \textbf{I also formally mentor undergraduate/graduate students in their research, and am receiving multiple requests to serve on their thesis committees and include them in my grant applications.}  I have had extensive formal training as a research mentor and instructor (see section on Professional Development below), including many years experience working in university research labs to support students. I have consistently received positive feedback from students, highlighting my ability to engage and inspire them. \textbf{By conferring graduate faculty status upon me, the institution would recognize my capability to contribute significantly to my continued mentoring and supervision of graduate students, as well as my commitment to advancing the institution's academic mission.}
